I have once again started developing a Minecraft launcher, as is every year. This one's staying though, and me and another dev, Ruby8360 have been working on it. It's called PyxelLauncher.

## What's different?
Unlike the last launcher pyCraft, this launcher is a fullly graphical application. It supports Microsoft and offline login, and it lets you install Fabric and Forge effortlessly. Essentially, it's meant to be easier and more functional for the user.

Changes have been made towards easily bundling the launcher and addin

## Why should I use this?
The official Minecraft launcher isn't portable, and I can guess that it doesn't work under strict networks, such as a library's network. PyxelLauncher is different. The official launcher also doesn't have offline login, which can be a significant issue if you don't have internet at the time you want to start up a local world. You also can't easily install Fabric/Forge within the official launcher.
In total, you get:
- Seamless modloader install built-in
- Portability
- Offline launching support
- Offline account support
- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) GUI, just the basics that you need.
- 20mb or less launcher size in total

## TLDR
New launcher, it's actively developed. pyCraft is no longer supported.
