hi there, you probably clicked on the link in my discord bio. 

as you can probably tell, i've left the app, due to it being an unstable mess, and recently crashing to no end on mobile. i've gotten sick of "fixing" an app that the users shouldn't ever have to deal with, so i'm just leaving it. 

here's my socials: 

notquitek3t   (snap, instagram, tiktok but its more unreliable) 
@k3t:k3t.tech (Matrix) 
k3t@k3t.tech  (iMessage, email) 
somek3t@riseup.net (email, more or less reliable than the other) 
untitledk3t   (reddit, i dont check this much)
